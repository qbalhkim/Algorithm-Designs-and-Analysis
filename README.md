# Algorithm-Designs-and-Analysis
 In this project, we focus on three important algorithms: Merge
 Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search. These are widely used for
 organizing and searching data efficiently.
 We implement the algorithms in Python and Java, compare
 their performance, and analyze their time and space complexity.
 Binary Search is also used to simulate searching in an AVL Tree.
 The idea is to see how these algorithms do, how fast are them
 and how do they perform in relation to the data size. This allows
 us to exert a strong emphasis on the design of professional
 algorithms and problemsolving.
